**Title:** Your Knowledge Graph Shouldn't Be a Black Box — Why We Built PrismRAG

**Subtitle hook:** When vectors decide what "related" means, your business loses control. Graph RAG was supposed to fix RAG — but for most enterprises, it created a new problem.

---

### The problem nobody talks about after the RAG demo

Everyone rushed to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** so AI could answer from *their* documents instead of the open internet.

Then reality hit:

- The model still **hallucinates** — because retrieval returns the wrong chunk.
- **Vector search** finds statistically similar text, not *business-meaningful* relationships.
- You can't explain why "revenue" landed next to "risk" in a query result.
- Compliance asks: *"Show us the rule."* And the answer is: *"The embedding model decided."*

So teams upgraded to **Graph RAG** — knowledge graphs, communities, multi-hop reasoning. Better demos. Harder operations.

Because standard Graph RAG does something subtle and dangerous:

> **It learns the graph from the documents.**

Co-occurrence statistics decide which concepts are related. "Bank" clusters with finance because those words appeared together often enough — not because *your* policy says so. Two hospitals reading the same clinical literature can end up with the **same** graph shape, even though their formularies, protocols, and risk models are completely different.

**The mapping layer — the most strategic part of enterprise knowledge — is outside business control.**

Your domain experts live in:

- Clinical pathways and drug categories
- Credit risk vs. market risk taxonomies
- Regulatory reporting lines vs. operational KPIs

But the system that powers AI search? That lives in **linear algebra you didn't author**.

That's not a small gap. It's why AI pilots stall in regulated industries, why legal won't sign off, and why agents still sound confident when they're wrong.

---

### Graph RAG isn't wrong. The *direction* is.

Graph RAG is powerful for traversal: communities, neighborhoods, re-ranking across clusters.

The mistake is **who owns the edges**.

| Standard Graph RAG | What enterprises actually need |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Documents define relationships | **You** define relationships |
| Same corpus → similar graph | Same corpus → **your** graph |
| "Why this result?" → statistics | "Why this result?" → **auditable rule** |
| Domain expertise in slide decks | Domain expertise **in the retrieval layer** |

You don't need another black-box vector space.  
You need **semantic re-mapping**: embed data *into* your model of the world, not discover the world from raw text.

---

### PrismRAG: invert the pipeline

**PrismRAG** is a semantic re-mapping engine built for exactly this inversion.

**Step 1 — You define the mapping**  
Categories and word→category rules: *your* healthcare, pharmacy, finance, or operations taxonomy — not Wikipedia's.

**Step 2 — Data is ingested into that space**  
Documents, SQL exports, APIs, spreadsheets — chunked, embedded, and **placed according to your rules**.

**Step 3 — Graph structure serves your mapping**  
Community detection and Graph RAG-style retrieval still run — but they route through **your** graph, not a statistical guess.

Same documents. Two tenants. Two completely different knowledge graphs — because **mapping is a first-class product feature**, not an accident of training data.

```
Standard Graph RAG:  Documents → statistics → graph → search
PrismRAG:            Your mapping → embed data → graph → search
```

---

### What changes in practice

**1. Auditability (Tier 1 — Rules)**  
Every retrieval can trace to a **mapping rule**: word → category → chunk → answer. When compliance asks *"why did the agent say that?"* — you show the rule chain, not a heatmap.

**2. Generalization without losing control (Tier 2 — Personal neural projection)**  
Optional ML trains on **your** rules to handle vocabulary you didn't explicitly list — while staying anchored to your categories, not random co-occurrence.

**3. Graph RAG — on your terms**  
Community routing, semantic re-ranking, bridge vectors across clusters — the performance pattern enterprises want, with a graph that reflects **domain expertise**, not document luck.

**4. Multi-domain reality (Deliberation)**  
Hard questions don't live in one silo. PrismRAG Deliberation runs **parallel domain experts** (clinical, financial, regulatory…) and synthesizes agreements and **conflicts** — grounded in the same mapped knowledge base when connected.

**5. Built for agents, not just chatbots**  
MCP-native tools (`search`, `submit_job`, `deliberate`, …) so Claude, GPT, and custom agents pull from **verified** retrieval — not a prompt-engineered workaround.

**6. Enterprise operations**  
Multi-tenant isolation, metering, audit logs, API-first — designed to run in production, not die in a POC.

---

### Who this is for

- **Healthcare & life sciences** — clinical, pharmacy, and safety categories you control
- **Financial services** — risk, valuation, and regulatory lenses on the same underlying data
- **Any regulated org** — where "the model said so" isn't an acceptable audit answer
- **Teams deploying AI agents** — who need grounding that survives scrutiny, not just demos

---

### The shift in one sentence

**Stop letting documents define your knowledge graph. Define the graph — then let AI reason on top of it.**

That's the difference between RAG that impresses in a meeting and RAG that earns trust in production.

---

### Try it

- **Live product:** https://prismrag.insightits.com
- **Playground** — map a domain and search in minutes
- **Plans** from free tier to enterprise — API + MCP included

If you're evaluating Graph RAG for 2025 and keep hitting the same wall — *"we can't explain the graph"* — this is the conversation worth having.

## 2. Short feed post

Copy-paste for LinkedIn feed (~1,300 characters):

```
Graph RAG was supposed to fix enterprise RAG.

Instead, many teams discovered a new problem: the knowledge graph still isn't theirs.

Standard Graph RAG learns relationships from document co-occurrence.
"Bank" becomes finance because words appeared together — not because your policy says so.

The mapping layer — the part that encodes how your business thinks — sits outside business control. Vectors decide. Compliance asks why. Nobody can show the rule.

PrismRAG flips the direction:

1. YOU define categories + mapping rules
2. Data embeds into your model
3. Graph RAG retrieval runs on YOUR graph — auditable, tenant-specific, domain-aware

Same documents. Different clients. Different graphs. On purpose.

✅ Trace retrieval → mapping rule → chunk
✅ Tier-1 rules + optional Tier-2 neural projection on your taxonomy
✅ Multi-domain Deliberation with conflict detection
✅ MCP-native for AI agents

Stop letting statistics define your knowledge graph.
Define the graph. Then let AI reason.

## 3. Carousel slide outline

**Format:** 1080×1080 or 1080×1350. Dark background, accent color for PrismRAG brand. One idea per slide.

| Slide | Headline | Body / visual |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **1 — Hook** | Your AI knows your documents. It doesn't know your business. | Subtext: "The mapping layer is still a black box." Logo + prism/graph visual. |
| **2 — The RAG promise** | RAG was supposed to fix hallucination. | Bullet: retrieve from YOUR data → answer with context. Visual: document → vector → LLM. |
| **3 — What went wrong** | Vectors find similarity. Not meaning. | "Why did 'bank' match finance?" → "The embedding decided." Red/warning accent. |
| **4 — Graph RAG upgrade** | Teams moved to Graph RAG. | Communities, multi-hop, better demos. But… next slide. |
| **5 — The hidden problem** | The graph learns from documents. | Co-occurrence statistics = relationships. YOUR taxonomy isn't in the loop. Diagram: docs at center, not business rules. |
| **6 — The inversion** | PrismRAG flips the pipeline. | **You** define mapping → data embeds into **your** model → graph serves **your** rules. Flow diagram left-to-right. |
| **7 — Same docs, different graphs** | Two clients. One corpus. Two knowledge graphs. | Side-by-side: Hospital A vs Hospital B categories. Emphasize tenant isolation. |
| **8 — Audit trail** | Every answer traces to a rule. | word → category → chunk → retrieval. "Compliance-ready by design." |
| **9 — Beyond search** | Deliberation + MCP for agents. | Multi-domain experts in parallel. Agents call `search` on verified data — not prompt hacks. |
| **10 — CTA** | Define your graph. Then let AI reason. | prismrag.insightits.com · Free tier · Playground · API + MCP. Button-style CTA. |

**Design notes:**

- Reuse hero graph SVG from `web/static/img/hero-graph.svg` on slides 6–7 if exporting from Figma/Canva.
- Slide 5 vs 6: use "documents at center" vs "your mapping at center" — mirrors `web/index.html` compare section.
- Keep body text ≤ 25 words per slide for mobile readability.

## 4. Healthcare vertical post

**Title angle:** Why clinical AI pilots fail — and how to put the formulary back in control

```
Healthcare teams didn't adopt RAG to summarize PubMed.

They adopted it to answer from protocols, formularies, prior auth policies, and internal clinical pathways — with traceability.

Then they hit the same wall as everyone else:

→ Vector search clusters "metformin" with whatever co-occurred in the corpus
→ Graph RAG builds communities from document statistics, not your pharmacy taxonomy
→ When a clinician asks "why this recommendation?", the answer is "the model retrieved it" — not "rule 4.2 in your P&T committee mapping"

In regulated care, that's not a technical nit. It's a governance blocker.

PrismRAG was built for this inversion:

1. Define YOUR categories — clinical, pharmacy, safety, billing, whatever your committees already use
2. Ingest EHR exports, policy PDFs, formulary spreadsheets into that mapping
3. Run Graph RAG retrieval on a graph that reflects your institution — not generic medical literature

Same clinical documents. Different hospitals. Different graphs. On purpose.

What changes for healthcare IT & clinical informatics:

✅ Audit trail: mapping rule → chunk → agent answer
✅ Tenant-isolated knowledge bases per system or business unit
✅ Deliberation across domains (clinical + pharmacy + compliance) with conflict surfacing
✅ MCP tools so clinical agents ground on verified retrieval

Stop letting document co-occurrence define your clinical knowledge graph.

Define the graph your committees already trust. Then deploy AI on top of it.

## 5. Finance vertical post

**Title angle:** Credit risk and market risk shouldn't share a graph because Excel co-occurred

```
Financial services ran to RAG for the right reason: answers grounded in internal research, policies, and client data — not training cutoffs.

Graph RAG promised the next step: relationships, communities, multi-hop reasoning across reports.

But here's what risk and compliance teams keep discovering:

The knowledge graph is still learned from documents.

"Exposure" links to "derivative" because those terms appeared together in the same filings — not because your risk taxonomy says they belong in the same cluster.

Credit risk, market risk, liquidity, and regulatory reporting each have **different lenses** on the same underlying data. A statistical graph collapses those lenses into one co-occurrence soup.

When audit asks "why did the agent classify this under operational risk?", the honest answer today is often: "the embedding space clustered it that way."

PrismRAG inverts the pipeline for finance:

1. **You** define categories — risk types, product lines, regulatory buckets
2. Word rules map vocabulary to **your** taxonomy (Tier-1 deterministic + optional Tier-2 neural projection)
3. Graph RAG traversal runs on **your** graph — same API patterns, business-owned structure

Two desks. Same research library. Different knowledge graphs — because mapping is the product, not an accident.

Benefits for risk, compliance, and engineering:

✅ Full traceability from retrieval result to mapping rule
✅ Multi-tenant isolation for desks, regions, or client segments
✅ Deliberation: parallel domain experts + synthesis of agreements and conflicts
✅ MCP-native agents that search verified stores — not re-prompted guesses

Your taxonomy already exists in policy docs and committee charters.

Put it in the retrieval layer.
